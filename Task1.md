# Accurate Circle Circumferrence / Area Calculator

## Description
* This calculator computes for the circumferrence and/or area of a circle up to N decimal digits.
* This calculator asks for an input from the user
* The inputs are:
   1. Radius "r",  and
   2. number of decimal places "N".

## Task
* create a calculator that computes the circumferrence and/or area of a circle to the Nth digit


## Example
* **Input**
* ```shell
	Radius: 4
	Decimal Places: 5
	```
* __Output__
* ```bash
	Circumferrence: 25.13272
	Area: 50.26544
	```

## Tip
* you can look for [Math.round](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/math_round_float.htm) or refer to this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11701399/round-up-to-2-decimal-places-in-java) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2538787/how-to-display-an-output-of-float-data-with-2-decimal-places-in-java)

## NOTE!
* I highly recommend you to answer these exercises ON YOUR OWN. That way, you'll learn how to actually code on your own.
* Your last resort is to ask help from each other or from me.
* Good luck! ;)
