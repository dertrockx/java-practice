# Number input checker (Try-catch exception exercise)

## Introduction

* In the world of software development, software run lots of errors called **Exception** during production. To avoid crashes due to errors, programmers plan ahead of time in catching in problems.

* We call this *try-catch* blocks. A **try-catch** block catches the **exception** so that it won't stop the program from executing.

* The **try** statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. 
* The **catch** statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

## Task Description
* create a simple program that checks a user's input if its a number.
* If it's a number, print "Yeah".
* If it's not a number, print("Not a number detected")

## Example
* Input
* ```shell
	Input: a
	```
* Output
* ```shell
	Not a number detected
	```
* Input
* ```shell
	Input: 1
	```
* Output
* ```shell
	Yeah	
	```
